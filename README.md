## 4. Deduplication strategy
To achieve deduplication of events across multiple listener instances.
This definition allows the system to safely drop duplicate events
while guaranteeing a single logical processing per unique event.

#### Event Identity
Each event contains a unique `event_id` generated by the producer.
Two events are considered duplicates if they share the same `event_id`,
regardless of arrival time or listener instance.
